# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Fiery! <img align="right" src="https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/ytc/AIdro_mGRdBXpxrZrPt6aw62Efolsw1U_2zDwBNGbKZJr_RenaI=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj">

### Who Am I?
I'm an enthusiastic and passionate undergraduate currently studying Computer Science at the University of East Anglia. 
My interests currently lie in Artificial Intelligence, Software Development and Web Development.

### My Projects
So far, most my projects are private. As UEA doesn't want next years students getting help from previous years. However, this page will start to fill once I create my own projects. 

#### However, you will have to take my word for the fact that I've built a:
- Movie database system, allowing sorting using **Java**
- Responsive and modern Website for Sustainability Goals using **HTML, CSS, & JS**
- Database for a library (how original ik) with **postGreSQL**
- Snack Shop system with **Java**
- Android app for those looking for jobs around a village using **Java and XML**

_With my newest projects towards the bottom_

In the summer of '24, I have plans to create a portfolio website or till ordering system (both using web technologies)
